# Hello, I'm Emily Gann
## I'm a Full-Stack Developer and recent grad of Flatiron School.

* :wrench: I am constantly tinkering with projects to include new features.
* :apple: Ever the student, I am working on mastering JS React and Redux.
* :checkered_flag: Goals: Learn more about data structures and algorithms!
* I enjoy being outside :cactus: (trying to attain a "green thumb" status), playing with my dogs :dog2::dog2::dog2:, learning to play the guitar :guitar:, and taking on new technology challenges
